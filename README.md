 ## Welcome to the Programming Logic Study Repository!

breaking them down into smaller steps, and organizing these steps systematically to create solutions.
This skill is essential for anyone interested in programming, regardless of the specific language or technology.

This repository is to share some studies using [Python](https://github.com/dennerricardo/github-dio/wiki/Python).
